# Book Tracking App

In this project, we want to make an app to customize your books in a virtual library. We have three shelves, first one is "currently reading". You can move any book in that shelf by changing the books status using dropdown button. Also, we have two other shelves, "want to read" and "read". If you want to remove one of the books you can easily click on none in the dropdown.

You also can add more books to your shelves by clicking on the "+" button. Search among all the books and change the status of the book to "want to read". 

## How to run the application

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` / `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` / `yarn start`
